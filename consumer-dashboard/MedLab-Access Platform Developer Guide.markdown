# Developer Guide: MedLab-Access Platform Development

## Overview
The MedLab-Access platform is designed as a centralized, scalable solution to improve medical laboratory access, sample referral, and blood donation logistics. The platform will be developed in phases over a year (as suggested by developers), starting with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) before additional features are incorporated. The key components of the platform include **eMedSample** (medical laboratory sample transport and report delivery) and **SharedBlood** (blood donation, screening, and transport). The following is a proposal based on discussion but can be adjusted as deemed necessary by both parties. Can refer to also the prototype and related links shared previously.

## Development Priorities & Timeline

### Phase 1: MVP Development

#### 1. Landing Page & Domain Setup
- Develop a responsive landing page with essential platform information, including service offerings, how the platform works, and contact details (refer to this link for idea: [https://denovohealthrides.mystrikingly.com/](https://denovohealthrides.mystrikingly.com/)).
- Register a domain and configure DNS settings to ensure platform accessibility.
- Implement email allocation for staff and organizational communications to establish official communication channels.

#### 2. User Registration & Role Management
- **User Data Collection Forms:**
  - Full Name, Email, Phone Number
  - Address (for service delivery & facility registration)
  - Government-issued ID (for verification where applicable)
  - Medical facility details (if registering as a service provider)
  - Blood donation eligibility details (for SharedBlood users)
  - Preferred communication method (SMS, Email, App Notifications)
  - Emergency contact (if applicable)
- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - Secure user authentication (Email/Password, OTP Verification)
  - Multi-factor authentication for enhanced security
  - OAuth integration (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- **Role-Based Access:**
  - **Service Provider Users:** Register facilities, update service availability, and receive requests.
  - **Consumer Users:** Place test/blood requests and track orders.
  - **DHR Biker Users:** Accept delivery requests and update status in real-time.
  - **Admin Users:** Manage platform settings, oversee operations, and resolve disputes.

#### 3. Order Placement & Tracking
- **Order Management:**
  - Enable healthcare facilities and individuals to place orders for laboratory tests or blood transfusions.
  - Define order categories: Blood request, Sample pickup, Lab test request.
- **Tracking Features:**
  - Order tracking by initiator with status updates (Pending, In Progress, Completed, Canceled).
  - Real-time GPS tracking for logistical efficiency to monitor delivery status.

#### 4. Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)
- Implement a system to track tests performed and blood components delivered by DHR staff.
- Include patient test history, sample tracking, and report generation features.
- Ensure data security and compliance with medical data protection standards.

### Phase 2: Payment & Notification System

#### 1. Payment Integration
- Implement a payment gateway with the ability to handle multiple transaction statuses:
  - Payment
  - Credit
  - Cash
  - Agreements
- Set up automated notifications for transaction status updates.

#### 2. Notification System
- Develop a notification system for platform-wide alerts.
- Implement real-time notifications for:
  - Order status updates (Placed, Accepted, Dispatched, Completed).
  - Payment updates and dispute resolutions.
  - System alerts and role-based notifications.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Logistics

#### 1. Log Sheet Integration
- Digitize existing log sheets for:
  - Sample referral
  - Result feeds
  - Blood drive logs
  - Consignment tracking
- Implement a structured logging mechanism for record-keeping.

#### 2. Client Self-Description Page
- Develop dedicated profile pages for individuals and facilities to list services and capabilities.
- Assign unique ID codes for easy identification and verification.
- Allow users to update service availability and manage their profiles.

#### 3. Facility Registration & Discovery System
- Enable public and private health facilities to register and showcase their capabilities.
- Implement a central DHR system to match requests with available facilities based on service type and location.
- Provide a platform for facilities to advertise their services and availability.

### Phase 4: Optimization & Full Deployment

#### 1. Advanced GPS Tracking
- Implement real-time GPS tracking for improved service delivery.
- Optimize logistics and route mapping for bikers.

#### 2. Platform Optimization & Scaling
- Conduct performance testing and bug fixes.
- Enhance user experience with UI/UX improvements.
- Ensure system security and data privacy compliance.

## Typical Platform Functionality Overview

### 1. User Workflow
- A patient/client needing a transfusion or laboratory test places an order through the platform.
- The central DHR system identifies the nearest available facility with the required service.
- The facility confirms availability, and the order is processed.
- The assigned DHR pick-up personnel ensures sample or blood delivery.
- Notifications and updates are sent to relevant parties.

## Future Additional Services for Sustainability
- **Rev-Med-Lab**
  1. **MedLabConsult (MLC):** Consultation services for laboratory management and training.
  2. **MedLabStock (MLS):** Logistics for medical laboratory consumables from suppliers to clients.
