Developer Guide: DHR SPACE Platform Development
Overview
The DHR SPACE platform is designed as a centralized, scalable solution to improve medical laboratory access, sample referral, and blood donation logistics. The platform will be developed in phases over a year (as suggested by developers), starting with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) before additional features are incorporated. The key components of the platform include eMedSample (medical laboratory sample transport and report delivery) and SharedBlood (blood donation, screening, and transport). The following is a proposal based on discussion but can be adjusted as deemed necessary by both parties. Can refer to also the protype and related links shared previously.

Development Priorities & Timeline Phase 1: MVP Development
1. Landing Page & Domain Setup
o Develop a responsive landing page with essential platform information, including service offerings, how the platform works, and contact details (refer to this link for idea; https://denovohealthrides.mystrikingly.com/ ).
o Register a domain and configure DNS settings to ensure platform accessibility.
o Implement email allocation for staff and organizational communications to
establish official communication channels. 2. User Registration & Role Management
o User Data Collection Forms:
▪ Full Name, Email, Phone Number
▪ Address (for service delivery & facility registration)
▪ Government-issued ID (for verification where applicable)
▪ Medical facility details (if registering as a service provider)
▪ Blood donation eligibility details (for SharedBlood users)
▪ Preferred communication method (SMS, Email, App Notifications) ▪ Emergency contact (if applicable)
o Authentication & Authorization:
▪ Secure user authentication (Email/Password, OTP Verification) ▪ Multi-factor authentication for enhanced security
▪ OAuth integration (Google, Facebook, etc.)
o Role-Based Access:
▪ ServiceProviderUsers:Registerfacilities,updateserviceavailability,and receive requests.
 
▪ Consumer Users: Place test/blood requests and track orders.
▪ DHRBikerUsers:Acceptdeliveryrequestsandupdatestatusinreal-time.
▪ Admin Users: Manage platform settings, oversee operations, and resolve disputes.
3. Order Placement & Tracking o Order Management:
▪ Enable healthcare facilities and individuals to place orders for laboratory tests or blood transfusions.
▪ Define order categories: Blood request, Sample pickup, Lab test request.
o Tracking Features:
▪ Order tracking by initiator with status updates (Pending, In Progress, Completed, Canceled).
▪ Real-time GPS tracking for logistical efficiency to monitor delivery status.
4. Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)
o Implement a system to track tests performed and blood components delivered by DHR staff.
o Include patient test history, sample tracking, and report generation features.
o Ensure data security and compliance with medical data protection standards. Phase 2: Payment & Notification System
1. Payment Integration
o Implement a payment gateway with the ability to handle multiple transaction
statuses:
▪ Payment ▪ Credit
▪ Cash

▪ Agreements
o Set up automated notifications for transaction status updates.
2. Notification System
o Develop a notification system for platform-wide alerts. o Implement real-time notifications for:
▪ Order status updates (Placed, Accepted, Dispatched, Completed).
▪ Payment updates and dispute resolutions.
▪ System alerts and role-based notifications.

Phase 3: Advanced Features & Logistics
1. Log Sheet Integration
o Digitize existing log sheets for:
▪ Sample referral
▪ Result feeds
▪ Blood drive logs
▪ Consignment tracking
o Implement a structured logging mechanism for record-keeping. 2. Client Self-Description Page
o Develop dedicated profile pages for individuals and facilities to list services and capabilities.
o Assign unique ID codes for easy identification and verification.
o Allow users to update service availability and manage their profiles. 3. Facility Registration & Discovery System
o Enable public and private health facilities to register and showcase their capabilities.

o Implement a central DHR system to match requests with available facilities based on service type and location.
o Provide a platform for facilities to advertise their services and availability. Phase 4: Optimization & Full Deployment
1. Advanced GPS Tracking
o Implement real-time GPS tracking for improved service delivery. o Optimize logistics and route mapping for bikers.
2. Platform Optimization & Scaling
o Conduct performance testing and bug fixes.
o Enhance user experience with UI/UX improvements. o Ensure system security and data privacy compliance.

Typical Platform Functionality Overview 1. User Workflow
o A patient/client needing a transfusion or laboratory test places an order through the platform.
o The central DHR system identifies the nearest available facility with the required service.
o The facility confirms availability, and the order is processed.
o The assigned DHR pick-up personnel ensures sample or blood delivery. o Notifications and updates are sent to relevant parties.
Future Additional Services for Sustainability o Rev-Med-Lab
1. MedLabConsult (MLC): Consultation services for laboratory management and training.
2. MedLabStock (MLS): Logistics for medical laboratory consumables from suppliers to clients.
